# Rust STB Vorbis - Ogg Vorbis Audio Decoder in pure rust

This is rust port of stb_vorbis (https://github.com/nothings/stb/).
Currently the code is not like usual rust code.
This is full of unsafe code, pointer arithmetic, and many C weird tricks.

I plan to cleanup the code a bit and provide a more rusty interface.
